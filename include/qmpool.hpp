//${QF::QMPool} ..............................................................
//! Native QF memory pool class
//!
//! @details
//! A fixed block-size memory pool is a very fast and efficient data
//! structure for dynamic allocation of fixed block-size chunks of memory.
//! A memory pool offers fast and deterministic allocation and recycling of
//! memory blocks and is not subject to fragmenation.@n
//! @n
//! The QP::QMPool class describes the native QF memory pool, which can be
//! used as the event pool for dynamic event allocation, or as a fast,
//! deterministic fixed block-size heap for any other objects in your
//! application.
//!
//! @note
//! The QP::QMPool class contains only data members for managing a memory
//! pool, but does not contain the pool storage, which must be provided
//! externally during the pool initialization.
//!
//! @note
//! The native QF event pool is configured by defining the macro
//! #QF_EPOOL_TYPE_ as QP::QMPool in the specific QF port header file.

    //! number of free blocks remaining
    QMPoolCtr volatile m_nFree;

    //! minimum number of free blocks ever present in this pool

    //! @param[in] poolSize size of the storage buffer in bytes
    //! @param[in] blockSize fixed-size of the memory blocks in bytes
    //!
    //! @attention
    //! The caller of QMPool::init() must make sure that the `poolSto`
    //! pointer is properly **aligned**. In particular, it must be possible to
    //! efficiently store a pointer at the location pointed to by `poolSto`.
    //! Internally, the QMPool::init() function rounds up the block size
    //! `blockSize` so that it can fit an integer number of pointers. This
    //! is done to achieve proper alignment of the blocks within the pool.
    //!
    //! @note
    //! Due to the rounding of block size the actual capacity of the pool
    //! might be less than (`poolSize` / `blockSize`). You can check the
    //! capacity of the pool by calling the QF::getPoolMin() function.
    //!
    //! @note
    //! This function is **not** protected by a critical section, because
    //! it is intended to be called only during the initialization of the
    //! system, when interrupts are not allowed yet.
    //!
    //! @note
    //! Many QF ports use memory pools to implement the event pools.

    //!
    //! @details

    //! pointer to the block back to the caller.
    //!
    //! @param[in] margin  the minimum number of unused blocks still
    //!                    available in the pool after the allocation.

    //! @note
    //! The memory pool must be initialized before any events can
    //! be requested from it. Also, the QP::QMPool::get() function uses

    //! call it from within a critical section when nesting of critical
    //! section is not supported.
