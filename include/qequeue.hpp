//${QF::QEQueue} .............................................................
//! Native QF Event Queue class
//!
//! @details
//! This structure describes the native QF event queue, which can be used as
//! the event queue for active objects, or as a simple "raw" event queue for
//! thread-safe event passing among non-framework entities, such as ISRs,
//! device drivers, or other third-party components.<br>
//!
//! The native QF event queue is configured by defining the macro
//! #QF_EQUEUE_TYPE as QP::QEQueue in the specific QF port header file.<br>
//!
//! The QP::QEQueue class contains only data members for managing an event
//! queue, but does not contain the storage for the queue buffer, which must
//! be provided externally during the queue initialization.<br>
//!
//! The event queue can store only event pointers, not the whole events. The
//! internal implementation uses the standard ring-buffer plus one external
//! location that optimizes the queue operation for the most frequent case
//! of empty queue.<br>
//!
//! The QP::QEQueue class is used with two sets of functions. One set is for
//! the active object event queue, which needs to block the active object
//! task when the event queue is empty and unblock it when events are posted
//! to the queue. The interface for the native active object event queue
//! consists of the following functions: QActive::post(), QActive::postLIFO(),
//! and QActive::get_(). Additionally the function QEQueue::init() is used
//! to initialize the queue.<br>
//!
//! The other set of functions, uses this class as a simple "raw" event
//! queue to pass events between entities other than active objects, such as
//! ISRs. The "raw" event queue is not capable of blocking on the get()
//! operation, but is still thread-safe because it uses QF critical section
//! to protect its integrity. The interface for the "raw" thread-safe queue
//! consists of the following functions: QP::QEQueue::post(),
//! QP::QEQueue::postLIFO(), and QP::QEQueue::get(). Additionally the
//! function QP::QEQueue::init() is used to initialize the queue.
//!
//! @note
//! Most event queue operations (both the active object queues and the "raw"
//! queues) internally use  the QF critical section. You should be careful
//! not to invoke those operations from other critical sections when nesting
//! of critical sections is not supported.

    //! When the queue is empty (which is most of the time), the extra
    //! m_frontEvt location allows to bypass the ring buffer altogether,
    //! greatly optimizing the performance of the queue. Only bursts of events
    //! engage the ring buffer.<br>

    //! The additional role of this attribute is to indicate the empty status
    //! of the queue. The queue is empty if the m_frontEvt location is nullptr.
