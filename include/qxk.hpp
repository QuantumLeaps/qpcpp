//! @details
//! QP::QXMutex is a blocking mutual exclusion mechanism that can also apply

//! (if initialized with a non-zero ceiling priority, see QXMutex::init()).
//! In that case, QP::QXMutex requires its own uinque QP priority level,

//! use the priority-ceiling protocol and does not require a unique QP
//! priority (see QXMutex::init()).
//! QP::QXMutex is **recursive** (re-entrant), which means that it can be
//! locked multiple times (up to 255 levels) by the *same* thread without
//! causing deadlock.<br>
//!
//! QP::QXMutex is primarily intended for the @ref QP::QXThread
//! "extended (blocking) threads", but can also be used by the
//! @ref QPP::QActive "basic threads" through the non-blocking
//! QXMutex::tryLock() API.
//!
//! @note
//! QP::QXMutex should be used in situations when at least one of the extended
//! threads contending for the mutex blocks while holding the mutex (between
//! the QXMutex::lock() and QXMutex_unlock() operations). If no blocking is
//! needed while holding the mutex, the more efficient non-blocking mechanism
